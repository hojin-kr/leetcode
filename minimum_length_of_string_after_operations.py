# 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations
# Medium

# Topics
# Companies

# Hint
# You are given a string s.

# You can perform the following process on s any number of times:

# Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
# Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
# Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
# Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.
